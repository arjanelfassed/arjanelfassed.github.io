# Agentschappen - Animated Bubble Chart

using [D3 version 4](https://d3js.org/)!

## Description

Data used is from 'Agentschappen in Beeld'(http://opendata.rijksbegroting.nl/#dataset_3) a set from the Dutch Ministry of Finance. Data include also years 2009, 2010 and 2011 but for this visualization only the data of the last three years have been used. The colors reflect the different government departments.

D3 version 4 has some significant API changes - especially to the force layout, which
is used in this bubble chart.

## Running

D3 needs to be run from a web server due to how it imports data files.
